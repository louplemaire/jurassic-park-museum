            <h2>Welcome to the forbidden part of the Catacombs of Paris</h2>
            <p>
                You're here 20 meters underground, that's five stories.
                In the part that is visible to the public you can reach by stairs, with a total of 243 steps. The part visible to the public is about 1500 meters long, but there is 11 000m² of surface area.
                Today we went down this big ladder because we are going to explore a small gallery that is forbidden to the public.
                For information there is a constant temperature of 14°C in any season.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Catacombs of Paris were built in the 18th century and opened to the public in 1809. Inside you can find the bones of several million Parisians.
                In the 18th century the cemeteries had health problems and it was decided to transfer their contents underground. At the time, the site was outside the capital. It was the quarry where the limestone was extracted in order to build, among other things, the Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral.
                It was from 1785 to 1787 that the first transfers of tombs took place.

            <h2>Bones</h2>
            <p>
                In the official part of the Catacombs the bones are all washed, then put away and positioned on the front. It is known that celebrities rest there but unfortunately not all the souls who are in these places are known.
                Today studies are being carried out on the proper preservation of the bones in this very humid underground environment while trying to understand who these Parisians were, to what social background they belonged, and why the bones were disposed of.

                Here, in the forbidden part, we do not find this rite.
                Namely that at that time, when this ossuary was still outside of Paris, smugglers used to pass through these galleries to smuggle the bones avoiding customs. They would spread the rumour that satanic things were going on in order to dissuade the curious from going into the ossuary.

            <h2>Bunker</h2>
            <p>
                Here we can see a walled door, this door was one of the entrances to a bunker. At that time there were 3 bunkers, one German, one collaborator and one from the resistance. These bunkers were connected and that's why the gallery network of the Catacombs of Paris was enlarged.

            <h2>Graffiti</h2>
            <p>
                The graffiti that you can see here are the traces of the passage of modern men who come against the law to "visit" the non-public part of the Catacombs of Paris.
                Some of them organize squats and parties in these places, all this is obviously forbidden.
